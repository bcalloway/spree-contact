h1. Spree Contact Form

This is a simply contact form you can install on your Spree Commerce site that will allow a user to send you a message off the site.
All the info is emailed to the recipient, as well as being written to the database.  Database records can be edited or destroyed, as well as exported in CSV format.

h2. Requirements

* Formstastic, "http://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic":http://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic
* Haml, "http://haml-lang.com/":http://haml-lang.com/
* FasterCSV, "http://rubyforge.org/projects/fastercsv/":http://rubyforge.org/projects/fastercsv/

h2. Known problems

* HAML templates cannot be parsed: Run <code>haml --rails <RAILS_ROOT></code> to create a plugin loader init.rb in vendor/plugins/haml

h2. Usage

* Place the contact extension before your site extension in SPREE_EXTENSIONS_LOAD_ORDER to overload templates and configuration preferences.
* Navigate to <code>/contacts/new</code> within your Spree application to see a contact form. The templates can be copied to your site extension for customization. Run <code>rake routes</code> for more advanced information.
